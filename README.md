# Homebridge Eufy Doorbell

I bought a Eufy Doorbell and had high hopes for the Homebridge plugin for it. After installing I saw it was quite buggy still.
I tried reading up on the existing code, but my gut said to rewrite it. So this is my attemt at it!

When I shared I was going to give this a shot, others suggested I'd put a Donate link on this repo.
So, if you feel like it, buy me a cup of motivational coffee üòä‚òïÔ∏è

## Build Plugin

TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. The following command will compile the contents of your [`src`](./src) directory and put the resulting code into the `dist` folder.

```
npm run build
```

## Link To Homebridge

Run this command so your global install of Homebridge can discover the plugin in your development environment:

```
npm link
```

You can now start Homebridge, use the `-D` flag so you can see debug log messages in your plugin:

```
homebridge -D
```

## Watch For Changes and Build Automatically

If you want to have your code compile automatically as you make changes, and restart Homebridge automatically between changes you can run:

```
npm run watch
```

This will launch an instance of Homebridge in debug mode which will restart every time you make a change to the source code. It will load the config stored in the default location under `~/.homebridge`. You may need to stop other running instances of Homebridge while using this command to prevent conflicts. You can adjust the Homebridge startup command in the [`nodemon.json`](./nodemon.json) file.

## Versioning Your Plugin

Given a version number `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`, such as `1.4.3`, increment the:

1. **MAJOR** version when you make breaking changes to your plugin,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can use the `npm version` command to help you with this:

```bash
# major update / breaking changes
npm version major

# minor update / new features
npm version update

# patch / bugfixes
npm version patch
```

## Publish Package

When you are ready to publish your plugin to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), make sure you have removed the `private` attribute from the [`package.json`](./package.json) file then run:

```
npm publish
```

If you are publishing a scoped plugin, i.e. `@username/homebridge-xxx` you will need to add `--access=public` to command the first time you publish.

#### Publishing Beta Versions

You can publish *beta* versions of your plugin for other users to test before you release it to everyone.

```bash
# create a new pre-release version (eg. 2.1.0-beta.1)
npm version prepatch --preid beta

# publsh to @beta
npm publish --tag=beta
```

Users can then install the  *beta* version by appending `@beta` to the install command, for example:

```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-eufy-doorbell@beta
```
